This is really just a desktop wrapper for the Color API - www.thecolorapi.com - but it's still a handly little utility. 

Total time to make: about 2.5 hours 

# Download as Linux (Ubuntu) program
Note that because this has PyQT bundled with it, it's a large file (comparatively speaking). The source code is only 7 KB, so if you have PyQT installed already, running this from the command line is a *much* better option. It's also why I didn't bother setting up packages for MacOS/Windows.
