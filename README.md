This is really just a desktop wrapper for the Color API - www.thecolorapi.com - but it's still a handly little utility. 

Total time to make: about 2.5 hours 

# Instructions
Because this uses PyQT, the size needed to package it makes it unreasonable at best. Therefore, you should run it from the command line with a simple 'python' command.
